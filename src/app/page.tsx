                        <p>
                            why? i found the game very fun and i wanted to try
                            to replicate it. the main purpose was to learn new
                            technologies such as vue.js.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            the game itself is very simple. you have to guess a
                            five-letter word within a limited number of
                            attempts. after each guess, the game shows you which
                            letters are in the correct position (in green),
                            which letters are in the wrong position (yellow),
                            and which letters are not part of the word at all
                            (grey).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p className="text-lg font-semibold">#2 beport</p>
                        <p>
                            beport is a website used to export your bereal
                            photos.
                        </p>
                        <Image
                            src="beport.jpg"
                            alt="beport image"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                        <p>
                            why? i found myself using this app called bereal. it
                            became a part of my routine, and i started
                            accumulating a lot of pictures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            one day, i tried to export all my photos to store
                            them for later, but there was a problem – i couldn't
                            find a way to do it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            sure, the app allowed individual exports of the
                            photos, but here's the thing: each export came with
                            a watermark. that's why i created beport.
